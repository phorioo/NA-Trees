## Description

Most of these assets are NOT survival friendly, and I recommend doing /gamerule randomTickSpeed 0 in game to avoid breaking debugged blocks. Alternatively if you're using Axiom, enabling No Updates will have the same effect :)
This collection was made in 1.21.5, so there may be missing blocks if you load it into an older version of Minecraft.

This collection contains .schem files for the following:
- Ponderosa Pine (12 Variants)
- Lodgepole Pine (12 Variants)
- Spruce (8 Variants)


## Use Rights

These assets are owned and distributed by me.

You may use these assets in your own creations/commissions without having to credit me, and use my work for the Marketplace as long as they have been appropriately combined with your own original work.

Please do not distribute/publish these assets without my permission, or distribute my work if it hasn't been appropriately transformed first.

You can message me on Discord (phorio.) if you have any questions or need help with the schematics.
